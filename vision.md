        <p>Inspired by his time at Holy Iviron Monastery on Mount Athos, Bozeman’s award-winning architect, Mark Headley, has offered a vision of what St. Peter’s Monastery might look like.  Mark is very familiar with the site and has already staked out the corners of the monastery he envisions.  His concept unfolds in five phases, allowing for the gradual build-out of the monastery as monks join the community and funds become available.</p>
        <p>Mark’s monastery is nestled on a south-facing hillside protected on the west by a rocky promontory and a short walk from the neo-classical villa that will eventually become part of the monastery.  Local ranchers have volunteered the stone piles in their fields gathered by the original homesteaders, and much of the building can be accomplished by the monks themselves using local materials and traditional methods.</p>

          <p>After site work, the First Level is stone masonry construction and includes workshops, a mechanical room, and stairs to the Second Level courtyard.</p>

          <p>The Second Level is the ground level courtyard and contains all the monastery’s eventual facilities, including the Katholicon (church) and Trapeza (dining room and kitchen).  Initially, however, Phase 2 will contain a temporary chapel, kitchen, dining room, and small dormitory.  Along with facilities already on the property, this will enable a small group of monks to pursue the daily prayer and worship routines of the monastery whilst later phases are under construction.</p>

          <p>The Third level would contain the monks’ cells and common areas as well as a prayer chapel in the tower over the entrance to the monastery enclosure.  When complete, the monastery will offer quarters for visitors and pilgrims outside the enclosure as well as a bookstore and conference rooms ideal for offering retreats and accommodating guests.</p>
