## Volunteer Work Week:

Adults and adults with children over 14 years old are welcome to work with our visiting monks for all or any part of this week.  Meals and tools, except work gloves, will be provided, but those who plan to stay overnight should bring a sleeping bag and tent, if desired.  All are welcome and encouraged to make a donation to the monastery to help cover the cost of meals and materials.
