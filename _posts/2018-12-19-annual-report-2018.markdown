-	To this end, the Foundation plans another Youth Camp, June 23-29, 2019 with Archbishop Benjamin celebrating Divine Liturgy with the Camp on Saturday, June 29, the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul;
-	In the absence of monastics, we are shifting our focus from construction to youth outreach while continuing to make work on the monastery a central feature of the Youth Camp.  We are working to engage more parishes and monastics in the Youth Camp with the hope of adding another youth camp in the summer of 2020;
-	Meanwhile, we will discontinue the Volunteer Work Week and use volunteers on an ad hoc basis this coming year;
-	We will continue in prayer for the growth, both spiritual and physical, of our brother Monastery in Manton and the calling of an Abbot and monastics to St. Peter’s.
